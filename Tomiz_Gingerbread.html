    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cookie Dough</li>
        <li>Mix softened butter, powdered sugar, and salt with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>Add the whole egg in several batches, mixing each time.</li>
        <li>Add the sifted dry ingredients and mix with a rubber spatula until the dough is no longer powdery.</li>
        <li>Place the dough between OPP sheets, set a ruler, and roll it out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 3mm.</li>
        <li>Chill the dough in the freezer until it is firm enough to cut out shapes easily.</li>
        <li>Use cookie cutters to cut the dough and place the shapes on a baking sheet lined with a sheet for better baking results.</li>
        <li>*If the dough becomes too soft and hard to cut, chill it in the freezer again.</li>
        <li>Baking</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 150°C (302°F) and bake for about 15-18 minutes. Once baked, cool the cookies on the baking sheet over a cake cooler until they reach room temperature.</li>
        <li>Icing</li>
        <li>Mix powdered sugar with dried egg whites.</li>
        <li>Add water and whisk until the mixture turns white and thick. Place the icing in a piping bag (or a makeshift cone) and seal the top with tape.</li>
        <li>*For how to make a piping bag (cone), please refer to this guide.</li>
        <li>Finishing</li>
        <li>Use the icing in the piping bag to decorate the cookies.</li>
        <li>Let the icing dry at room temperature, and your cookies are ready!</li>
